Narrative-driven bartending game prototype built in Godot.


This project explores:
- Interactive UI systems
- State-driven gameplay logic
- Drag-and-drop mechanics
- Narrative branching


I built this as a personal project to learn game systems design and rapid prototyping.


Tech:
- Godot 4
- GDScript
- Custom UI + interaction logic


Status: early prototype
